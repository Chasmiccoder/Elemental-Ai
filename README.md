Using Dracula.js to plot graphs



<!-- 

Things done during trial run:
npm install browserify -g

npm init
Use defaults

npm install lodash jquery --save

Then write the code in a folder called dist, in a file names bundle.js
Then create an empty file bundle.js in the root folder, and run this command

browserify dist/bundle.js -o bundle.js

Now, bundle.js in the root folder has the code from dist/bundle.js and the required code from lodash and jquery

Do the same, but for Dracula js
