* Need to generalize Water Jug Problem with N jugs instead of 2
* Write better comments
* Put graph definition in a separate JS file 
    (will have to change functions like isStatePresent since they are problem specific)
* When the project will be assembled common functions like makeMove() will also break (can fix this using classes)
* Optimize all makeMove() functions
* [0,1,"Left Bank"] Error! in M&C
